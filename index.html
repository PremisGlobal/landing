          <p>The team at Premis Global is reaching out because we noticed your successful property management business. We are building an online platform to help landlords like yourself grow their business. Our goal is to make the day to day operations of managing properties pain free and more efficient through a simple and easy to use website. </p>

<p>We are working with several landlords already to design this solution and would love to have your input as well. Your contributions to the design process would help us tailor the product to your management, marketing, and tenant needs.</p>

<p>If you are interested, we would like to schedule a phone or in person conversation to learn more about your business and how our team can help yours. Please reply back to this email to begin the conversation. If we do not receive a reply we promise not contact you again.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing back from you and hope that this is the start of a long and successful partnership!</p>
